Title: R functions for working with metabarcoding data
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Ramon Gallego Simon
Maintainer: Ramon Gallego Simon <ramongallego@gmail.com>
Description: A series of R functions that come in handy while working with metabarcoding data. Made by Ramon Gallego while working at the Kelly Lab (). The reasoning of doing this is to have the same functions we use all the time stored in a curated, reproducible way. And so end with the different transforming functions. In a way it is all about putting together the grammar of the tidyverse with the functions we have used in community ecology.
